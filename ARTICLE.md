# Write accessible HTML emails that work everywhere

The complexity of the work of the web developer has always been to make its code works everywhere. Solutions like jQuery and Babel came to help the professional to save his time with compatibility of browser and spend his time with the new features. That age of incompatibilities for browsers is gone since we dont't need to support the Internet Explorer.

Now talking about emails there's another enemy, the IE of the email clients called Outlook. I dont't understand the real it's not updated to a new app that works with modern HTML and CSS, but until there I'm happy to do my best and overcome this challenge.
